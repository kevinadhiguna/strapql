title: 📤 🖼️ Upload a single image in separate fields

>Hmm... but how do I upload a single image to several fields in a single request?

All right, imagine you created a collection type which has several fields, including `cardImage`, `facePhoto`, and `personWithCardPhoto`. Otherwise, just replace those fields with yours. Ok, here we go :
```graphql
mutation UploadSingleImageToSeveralFields(
  $ref: String
  $refId: ID
  $cardImage: Upload!
  $facePhoto: Upload!
  $personWithCardPhoto: Upload!
) {
  cardImage: upload(
    ref: $ref
    refId: $refId
    field: "cardImage"
    file: $cardImage
  ) {
    id
    createdAt
    updatedAt
    name
    alternativeText
    caption
    width
    height
    formats
    hash
    ext
    mime
    size
    url
  }
  facePhoto: upload(
    ref: $ref
    refId: $refId
    field: "facePhoto"
    file: $facePhoto
  ) {
    id
    createdAt
    updatedAt
    name
    alternativeText
    caption
    width
    height
    formats
    hash
    ext
    mime
    size
    url
  }
  personWithCardPhoto: upload(
    ref: $ref
    refId: $refId
    field: "personWithCardPhoto"
    file: $personWithCardPhoto
  ) {
    id
    createdAt
    updatedAt
    name
    alternativeText
    caption
    width
    height
    formats
    hash
    ext
    mime
    size
    url
  }
}
```

Variables :
```json
{
  "ref": "YOUR_COLLECTION_TYPE_NAME",
  "refId": "ID_OF_YOUR_ENTRY_IN_YOUR_COLLECTION_TYPE"
}
```

<b>Please do not forget to attach your files with variables' names.</b><br/>
Note: In this case, the variables' names are `cardImage`, `facePhoto`, and `personWithCardPhoto`.

Here is an example :<br/>

### 🚀 How does `UploadSingleImageToSeveralFields` mutation work ?

In the `UploadSingleImageToSeveralFields` mutation above, you still need `ref`, `refId`, and field name. However you are sending a request to a collection type and are trying to attach images in a single record inside the collection type. So, you are able to set `ref` and `refId` as variables. The field name ? You should name it statically as you want to upload an image in different fields. Hopefully this approach helps :)
